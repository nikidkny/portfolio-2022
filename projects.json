    "fullDesc": "My chosen font - \"Nunito\", sans-serif was used  as body font , while \"Alegreya\", serif was to display font for headers and UI elements. Working with different fonts has made me realise the importance of  spacing, font weights and margins.<br>As for the second part of the project I improved the UI components including cards with a list of users with provided details and CTAs. This part of the assignment required the use of color on interactive elements and subtle border colors as well.",

    "fullDesc": "I started this assignment by creating the mobile version first and then adding few media query entries modifying the grid behaviour and modifying the base font size. Creating a responsive websites is something that should always be kept in mind during the coding processes, as users will visit the page on different devices.  I decided to use white as the background color and use some simple but bright colors to achive a bigger contrast.",

    "shortDesc": "Goal of this assignment was apply a color pallet to a mockup landing page design, then add animations.  It consist of  three parts: the first part is to apply a color palette, the second part is to create a dark theme and the last part is to add animations.",
    "fullDesc": "In this assignment I generated a color palette on huemint.com. The colors I decided to go with were more colourful than I would have done previously, but in order to challenge myself, and really see how can I work with colors  this was important. The primary color of my design is a colder toned turquoise that leans more on the green side. The secondary color is a dark shade of green that is capturing user's attention to important elements like headers and icons. The last color is similar to Rust Red for an accent color as CTA buttons, links. This webpage also includes animations created with CSS animation with the Web Animations API in JavaScript. As the last element of the process I included a media query altering my website in case of users using a 'Dark Mode' since my website was pretty dark already the changes are rather miniscule.",

    "shortDesc": "This project is to showcase the usage of databases and their manipulation, JavaScript functions, closures, arrays, flags amongst other things.",
    "fullDesc": "In this assignment there were several user requirements.  Firstly, the data of the students from a json URL needed to be fetched and formatted/cleaned up by my code. Other data related to these students (their blood type) are stored at a different json URL and needed to be calculated and assigned to each student.  Then, the students needed to be displayed as a list, which can be sorted by first and last names, group them by criteria (houses, responsibilities), filtered by house, enrolled or expelled students and searched by at least name.  Adding to these, the user had to be able to remove from the list of students and add to expelled. There were different responsibilities that the user needed to be able to assign to students and, for some, to take these away. As for the last function, the system needed to be “hacked”. In this, when a specific keystroke (in my case these were the number 1 and the letter n) is entered multiple things happen. My data is inserted in the list permanently (not being able to expel only after reloading disappear), the blood type data is disarranged and being part of the inquisitorial squad is only for a limited time.",
