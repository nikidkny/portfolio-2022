    "fullDesc": "My chosen font - \"Nunito\", sans-serif was used  as body font , while \"Alegreya\", serif was to display font for headers and UI elements. Working with different fonts has made me realise the importance of  spacing, font weights and margins.As for the second part of the project I improved the UI components including cards with a list of users with provided details and CTAs. This part of the assignment required the use of color on interactive elements and subtle border colors as well.",

    "fullDesc": "In this assignment I generated a color palette on huemint.com. The colors I decided to go with were more colourful than I would have done previously, but in order to challenge myself, and really see how can I work with colors  this was important. The primary color of my design is a colder toned turquoise that leans more on the green side. The secondary color is a dark shade of green that is capturing user's attention to important elements like headers and icons. The last color is similar to Rust Red for an accent color as CTA buttons, links. This webpage also includes animations created with CSS animation with the Web Animations API in JavaScript. As the last element of the process I included a media query altering my website in case of users using a 'Dark Mode' since my website was pretty dark already the changes are rather miniscule.",

Creating a responsive websites is something that should always be kept in mind during the coding processes, as users will visit the page on different devices.

    "fullDesc": "In this assignment there were several user requirements.  Firstly, the data of the students from a json URL needed to be fetched and formatted/cleaned up by my code. Other data related to these students (their blood type) are stored at a different json URL and needed to be calculated and assigned to each student.  Then, the students needed to be displayed as a list, which can be sorted by first and last names, group them by criteria (houses, responsibilities), filtered by house, enrolled or expelled students and searched by at least name.  Adding to these, the user had to be able to remove from the list of students and add to expelled. There were different responsibilities that the user needed to be able to assign to students and, for some, to take these away. As for the last function, the system needed to be “hacked”. In this, when a specific keystroke (in my case these were the number 1 and the letter n) is entered multiple things happen. My data is inserted in the list permanently (not being able to expel only after reloading disappear), the blood type data is disarranged and being part of the inquisitorial squad is only for a limited time.",

Timeline was useful to sequence animations, where each on runs after the previous. The second js file, `multiballs`, contains an example of how to use a single animation that works just as querySelectorAll would and animate multiple object.",

    "fullDesc": "This project had 2 main focus. Firstly, create a website that is sustainable and performs well on Lighthouse testing. In order to achieve that, we have decided to use NextJs as a framework as it is pre-rendered by default and at build time. Adding to that, we have only used svg images as those are scaleable and can be compressed and just minimal animation that is to help the user understand the consequences of using energy (the idea was to animate the trees to appear as many as many trees needed to offset the energy). Secondly, to create a tool that helps measuring the user's environmental footprint with an understandable methaphor. We have chosen to illustrate the relation between streamings energy usage and electric car travelling, and additionally that how many trees were needed to offset the energy generated by time spent streaming.",
